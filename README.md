## client folder
The client folder contains a vue program
which should be run from the following command
I didn't work much on the appearance, maybe I'll get to that later
```
npm run dev
```


## server folder

The server folder contains a simple restful api written with express that you can run the server with the following command

```bash
npm start
```
    
## thank you
