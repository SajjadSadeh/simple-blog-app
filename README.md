## client folder

The client folder contains a view program
which should be started from the command
```
npm run dev
```
I didn't work much on its appearance, maybe I'll get to that later


## server folder

The server folder contains a simple restful api written with express that you can run the server with the following command

```bash
npm start
```
    
## thank you
